This repository contains some of my basic games, which are made using the C/C++ programming language and the graphics.h library in devC++
The video tutorial for installing graphics.h is the following URL

The video description contains links for installing the graphics.h library, which is also present in the repository.
Also, the version of devC++ used here is provided as a setup file.

It contains mainly 3 games
- Soccer Stars (Soccer_Stars_explained [.exe/.cpp] )
- Air Hockey (Air_Hockey_Final [.exe/.cpp] )
- Moving Ball (development [.exe.cpp] )

And a variation of the Soccer_stars game which is the "Windows Screen Saver.exe" which resembles the Bubbles screen saver in Windows.
.exe files are attached so as to allow them to play the game without having to install devC++ and graphics.h on their device.

-- THE END--
